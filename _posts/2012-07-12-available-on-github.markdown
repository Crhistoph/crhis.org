The data for this blog is now [available as a GitHub repo](https://github.com/Crhistoph/crhis.org). It's a new repo and there's likely a lot of cleaning up that still needs doing but it's up there, and I hope that by putting my stuff up in public I'll do better things with it. 

The license permissions are in the README.markdown.
