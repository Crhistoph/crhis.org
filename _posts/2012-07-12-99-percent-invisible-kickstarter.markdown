title: 99% Invisible Kickstarter

One of my favourite podcasts, [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org) is has put Season 3 of the show [up on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748303376/99-invisible-season-3).

Each episode is between 10 and 20 minutes long and covers some aspect of architecture or design.

One of my favourite episodes (and it seems, Roman's too) is linked right at the top of the Kickstarter page.

[The Accidental Music of Imperfect Escalators](http://99percentinvisible.org/post/14446893953/episode-43-the-accidental-music-of-imperfect)

> Ever since the industrial revolution, when it became possible for products to be designed just once and then mass produced, it has been the slight imperfections and wear introduced by human use that has transformed a quality mass produced product into a thing we love. Your worn blue jeans, your grandmothers iron skillet, the initial design determined their quality, but itâ€™s their imperfections that make them comfortable, that make them lovable, that make them yours.

And the reason I'd rather have a notebook 'gift' from the Kickstarter than a t-shirt.

> The classic 99% Invisible logo, designed by Stefan Lawrence, on a handsome asphalt t-shirt. You are guaranteed to spend minutes a day talking about your favorite radio show as you explain to people how it has nothing to with the occupy movement.
