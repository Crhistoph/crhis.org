title: The Dial-Up Modem Sound
---
The Atlantic looks at [what the noise you hear when you connect a dial-up modem actually is](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-mechanics-and-meaning-of-that-ol-dial-up-modem-sound/257816/).

>Of all the noises that my children will not understand, the one that is nearest to my heart is not from a song or a television show or a jingle. It's the sound of a modem connecting with another modem across the repurposed telephone infrastructure. It was the noise of being part of the beginning of the Internet.

The sound is [transcibed visually at soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/john-pemberton/modem-dialup).
